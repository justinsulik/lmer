# lmer

These are the materials for an R `lmer` course (MPI for Psycholinguistics, Oct/Nov 2017). Each week's material is in a separate folder, and each folder is labelled either with my initials (JS) or Louis ten Bosch (LtB) to indicate who prepared/will deliver the material, so you know who to direct particular questions to. 

The material will usually only be made available on the day in question (though it will remain available after that day). 

In general: 
.md files contain R code+output that can be read here in the browser. 
.R or .Rmd files contain the R code (no output) that can be opened in R studio, and run from there

You can download files individually from this repository, or you can install github desktop to handle the files for you.
